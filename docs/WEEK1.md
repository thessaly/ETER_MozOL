## Assignment: Reflecting on Benefits and Challenges of Working Open

### Benefits
More impact    
More eyes hacking the handbook and making it better    
Possibility of connecting with people doing the same elsewhere    
A more flexible, situated approach that can be useful for more contexts than ours

### Challenges
How to generate a community?    
How to manage diversity of criteria?    
How to manage collaborations?

### Limitations
Do we have the time?!    
How do we assign roles, which roles?
