# ETER: A hackable open source methodology to design low-cost educational community science projects

## Roadmap

### Milestone 1: Create a prototype of a game for teachers to learn about the potential and benefits of open source practices in education

1- Define the main idea: Which message do we want to transmit? Who are we talking to?
2- Do some research on open science games
3- Create the game story, characters, rewards, rankings, etc.
4- Which resources do we need, which ones do we have
5- Design the interface (back & forth with teachers)
6- Set up the infrastructure
7- Get a functional prototype working at rlab.be

### Milestone 2: Create a prototype of the hackable handbook containing minimum requirements (mvp)

1- Define a possible index
2- Do research on OER formats
3- Set up infrastructure
4- Define collaboration guidelines
5- Have a working prototype
6- Start filling it with content from local teachers


### Milestone 3: Test the game & handbook at Mozilla Global Sprint (may 10-11)

1- Check collaboration guidelines
2- Check infrastructure
3- Testing day at school
